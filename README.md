# greener-darker-mint-theme
A customized version of the Mint-Y-Dark theme for Cinnamon.

It is basically the Mint-Y-Dark theme, but with higher contrast and a few other tweaks that I like for aesthetic reasons : black backgrounds rather than grey, a bright green instead of the mint-classic light green.

I uploaded the whole file directory here, even the files I have not modified, so that it makes sense as a whole.

It is not finished.
It still has a few glitches and things that are not the color I intend them to be. And I haven't gotten around to editing the icons yet.
